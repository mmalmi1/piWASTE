## Unit tests
Unit tests are located at [tests/test_*](#/tests).
The tests will automatically be run on every commit on `master` branch, and every commit on branches that have pull requests targeting `master`.

To run the unit tests locally, make sure you have `pytest` installed, and run:
```bash
python -m pytest
```
